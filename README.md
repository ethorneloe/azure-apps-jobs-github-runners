# Overview
This repository provides a step-by-step guide on configuring KEDA-scaled self-hosted GitHub runners as Azure Container Apps Jobs, using GitHub App authentication.

# Goals
- To provide easy-to-follow configuration steps suitable for learning and experimentation using Azure CLI.
- To help familiarise the reader with each individual Azure resource and component in the solution, how they interact together, and to raise noteworthy customisation options along the way.
- IaC based deployment options might be added later on, however, there is already a fantastic repo with an IaC deployment option [here](https://github.com/xmi-cs/aca-gh-actions-runner)

# Prerequisites
- An Azure subscription with priviledged access.
- A GitHub account.
- Familiarity with Azure resource deployment, GitHub repo configuration.

# Advantages of Azure Container Apps Jobs
- **Ephemeral Execution** - Each job runs in its own container which is created and destroyed whenever the job needs to execute.
- **Reduced Costs** -  Cost is based on job execution time as opposed to a VM that accrues cost even while idling.
- **Flexibility and Independence** - Dockerfiles and entrypoints can be customised to suit different jobs with different dependencies.
- **Auto-Scaling** - The KEDA scaler takes care of spinning up a new container whenever new jobs are queued.  Each job runs in its own container for parallel execution.
